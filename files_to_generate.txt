# ==== FILES TO COG ==========
# ============================
# == This file lists all of the files in this project that have pieces
# == that need to be generated and/or preprocessed by "cog" using configurations
# ============================
#
# this is the general relativity definition file
solver/include/grDef.h

# physcon.cpp is the physical conditions file (deals with psi, ham, and mom)
solver/src/physcon.cpp

# RHS set-up for evolution equations:
solver/src/rhs.cpp

# and then the KO calculation to be used
generated-files/solver_rhs_ko_deriv_calc.cpp.inc

# then evolution constraints need to be generated
solver/src/solver_constraints.cpp

# we also need to generate the parameters
solver/src/parameters.cpp
solver/include/parameters.h
